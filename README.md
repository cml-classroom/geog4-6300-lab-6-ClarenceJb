* Question 1: Good<p>
* Question 2: Maps look pretty good.<p>
* Question 3: Question working was maybe confusing here, but this was just about the variables/maps from Q2. But still interesting!<p>
* Question 4: This is OK--could be a little more specific about the units of measurement.<p>
* Question 5: Good<p>
* Question 6: Similar to Q4. Keeping the units of measurement in mind when interpreting things helps make sense of how large the coefficients are. <p>
* Question 7: I'd say the coast really is what stands out imo.<p>
* Question 8: Good<p>
* Question 9: What are the results? Needed to be more specific here about what the headline findings were.<p>

* Challenge:<p>
<p>
General feedback: I'll mark as complete, but keep working on the interpretation piece.
